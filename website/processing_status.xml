    <p>
      This page is periodically updated to reflect the current
      status of the CSC 2.0. Up until the Galactic center - which is,
      by far, our largest set of overlapping
      <dictionary id="stack">stacks</dictionary> - the observations were
      processed in chunks, with all sources from a set of contiguous
      stacks being processed together. As the Galactic center region
      is so large, and is the only area of the sky left to process,
      the sources are now being added to the 
      <span class="term">Current Database</span>
      as they get processed.
      The list of stacks in CSC 2.0 and whether they have been
      fully processed is available as the text file:
      <cxclink class="filename"  href="stacks.txt">stacks.txt</cxclink>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The catalog can also be viewed using the 
      <cxclink href="wwt.html">WorldWide Telescope</cxclink>,
      which lets users select stacks or sources.
