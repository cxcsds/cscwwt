# Use 4XMM-DR11

This is based on the code written for 3XMM-DR8.

From http://xmmssc.irap.omp.eu/Catalogue/4XMM-DR11/4XMM_DR11.html

we have

    The slimline version of the catalogue contains one row per unique source
    (while the the main catalogue has one row per detection) and thus has 602543 rows.

The slim columns are described at

    http://xmmssc.irap.omp.eu/Catalogue/4XMM-DR11/col_unsrc.html

We are probably interested in

    SC_SUM_FLAG (J)
    The summary flag for the unique source SRCID is taken to be the worst flag of all
    detections of this source (SUM_FLAG).

The SUM_FLAG value is described at

    http://xmmssc.irap.omp.eu/Catalogue/4XMM-DR11/col_flags.html#sumflag

and is

    SUM_FLAG (J)

    The summary flag of the detection is derived from the EPIC flag (EP_FLAG, see 2XMM UG Sec. 3.1.2 h)
    and Sec. 3.2.6  but note also sections 3XMM-DR4 UG 3.11 and 3.7). It is 0 if none of the nine flags
    was set; it is set to 1 if at least one of the warning flags (flag 1, 2, 3, 9) was set but no
    possible-spurious-detection flag (flag 7, 8); it is set to 2 if at least one of the possible-spurious-detection flags (
    flag 7, 8) was set but not the manual flag (flag 11); it is set to 3 if the manual flag (flag 11) was
    set but no possible-spurious-detection flags (flag 7, 8); it is set to 4 if the manual flag (flag 11)
    as well as one of the possible-spurious-detection flags (flag 7, 8) is set. The meaning is thus:
    
    0 = good,
    1 = source parameters may be affected,
    2 = possibly spurious,
    3 = located in a area where spurious detection may occur,
    4 = located in a area where spurious detection may occur and possibly spurious.

    For details see 2XMM UG Sec. 3.2.7 but note that flag 12 is now used to indicate that the source is on
    or near warm pixels (see Webb et al. (2020))

The 4XMM documentation suggests using SUMMARY<3 as a determinant

The 4XMM-DR11 table lists

    895415    detections
    787963    'clean' detections (SUM_FLAG < 3)
    602543    Number of sources

% dmlist 4XMM_DR11cat_slim_v1.0.fits.gz"[2]" counts
602543  
% dmlist 4XMM_DR11cat_slim_v1.0.fits.gz"[2][sc_sum_flag=:2]" counts
521669  

% dmlist 4XMM_DR11cat_v1.0.fits.gz"[2]" counts
895415  
% dmlist 4XMM_DR11cat_v1.0.fits.gz"[2][sum_flag=:2]" counts
787963  

Let's follow the DR8 approach and use detections, rather than sources, and
just apply the SUM_FLAG filter.
